# Gaming Website

## Description
This project is a gaming website that showcases a variety of games. It is divided into two main sections: the Games Section, where users can view a list of games, and the Details Section, where users can view detailed information about each selected game. Each section communicates with its own API to fetch and display the relevant data.

## Features
- **Games Section**: Displays a list of games fetched from an API.
- **Details Section**: Shows detailed information about a selected game, including gameplay details and specifications.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to work on various devices.
- **Organized Code Structure**: The project uses JavaScript classes to separate functionality and improve code organization.
